This homework is about exploratory data analysis. We learn how to load data, sort data and  data visulization.
We also learn to find the statistical properties such as mean, variance, median, etc. We also showed heat map
plotting and show the correlation of data columns. 

I did this homework without getting help from others and only by myself.
